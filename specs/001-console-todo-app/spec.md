# Feature Specification: Phase I Console Todo App

**Feature Branch**: `001-console-todo-app`
**Created**: 2025-12-28
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: Phase I: Todo In-Memory Python Console App with CRUD operations

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View Task List (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to see all my tasks displayed in a clear, numbered list so I can quickly understand what I need to do and track which tasks are complete.

**Why this priority**: Viewing tasks is the foundational feature that enables all other interactions. Without being able to see tasks, users cannot manage them.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by launching the app and selecting "list" from the menu. Even with zero tasks, the system displays an appropriate message.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** no tasks exist, **When** user selects "list tasks", **Then** system displays "No tasks found" message
2. **Given** 3 tasks exist (1 complete, 2 incomplete), **When** user selects "list tasks", **Then** system displays all 3 tasks with ID, title, and status indicator (e.g., [x] for complete, [ ] for incomplete)
3. **Given** tasks exist, **When** user views the list, **Then** each task shows its ID number for reference in other operations

### User Story 2 - Add New Task (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to add new tasks with a title and optional description so I can capture what I need to do.

**Why this priority**: Adding tasks is equally critical to viewing - without adding tasks, the application has no content to manage.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by selecting "add" from the menu, entering task details, and verifying the task appears in the list.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the main menu is displayed, **When** user selects "add" and enters title "Buy groceries", **Then** a new task is created with that title and appears in the task list
2. **Given** user is adding a task, **When** user enters title "Call doctor" and description "Schedule annual checkup", **Then** both title and description are saved with the task
3. **Given** user is adding a task, **When** user provides an empty title, **Then** system displays an error and prompts for a valid title
4. **Given** user adds a task, **When** the task is created, **Then** it is assigned a unique sequential ID and defaults to incomplete status

---

### User Story 3 - Mark Task Complete/Incomplete (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to toggle the completion status of tasks so I can track my progress.

**Why this priority**: Tracking completion is the core value proposition of a todo app - knowing what's done vs. pending.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding a task, marking it complete, viewing the updated status, then marking it incomplete again.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an incomplete task exists with ID 1, **When** user selects "complete" and enters ID 1, **Then** task 1 is marked as complete and shows [x] indicator
2. **Given** a complete task exists with ID 2, **When** user selects "complete" and enters ID 2, **Then** task 2 is toggled to incomplete and shows [ ] indicator
3. **Given** user enters a non-existent task ID, **When** attempting to toggle completion, **Then** system displays "Task not found" error

---

### User Story 4 - Update Task Details (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want to modify the title or description of existing tasks so I can correct mistakes or add more detail.

**Why this priority**: Updating is less critical than create/complete but enables iterative refinement of task details.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding a task, updating its title and/or description, and verifying changes persist in the list view.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a task exists with ID 1 and title "Buy food", **When** user selects "update", enters ID 1, and provides new title "Buy groceries", **Then** task title is changed to "Buy groceries"
2. **Given** a task exists with no description, **When** user updates it with description "From the farmers market", **Then** the description is added to the task
3. **Given** user is updating a task, **When** user provides an empty title, **Then** system displays an error and the original title is preserved
4. **Given** user enters a non-existent task ID, **When** attempting to update, **Then** system displays "Task not found" error

---

### User Story 5 - Delete Task (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want to remove tasks I no longer need so my list stays relevant and uncluttered.

**Why this priority**: Deletion is a cleanup operation, less frequent than core CRUD but necessary for list hygiene.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding a task, deleting it, and verifying it no longer appears in the list.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a task exists with ID 3, **When** user selects "delete" and enters ID 3, **Then** task 3 is removed from the list
2. **Given** user deletes a task, **When** viewing the task list afterward, **Then** the deleted task no longer appears
3. **Given** user enters a non-existent task ID, **When** attempting to delete, **Then** system displays "Task not found" error

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when user enters non-numeric input where ID is expected? System displays "Invalid input: please enter a number" and re-prompts
- What happens when user enters negative ID? System displays "Invalid ID: must be a positive number"
- How does system handle extremely long titles (>200 characters)? System accepts them but may truncate display in list view
- What happens when user presses Ctrl+C or EOF during input? Application exits gracefully with a goodbye message
- How does system handle special characters in titles/descriptions? All printable characters are accepted and stored

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide an interactive main menu with options: add, list, update, delete, complete, and quit
- **FR-002**: System MUST assign unique, sequential integer IDs to tasks starting from 1
- **FR-003**: System MUST store tasks in memory with title (required), description (optional), and completion status (boolean)
- **FR-004**: System MUST display task list with ID, completion status indicator, and title for each task
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate that task titles are non-empty before accepting
- **FR-006**: System MUST display descriptive error messages for invalid inputs (non-existent IDs, empty titles, non-numeric input)
- **FR-007**: System MUST return to the main menu after completing each operation
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide a quit/exit option that terminates the application gracefully
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle keyboard interrupts (Ctrl+C) gracefully without crash

### Key Entities

- **Task**: Represents a single todo item with the following attributes:
  - ID: Unique sequential integer identifier (auto-assigned)
  - Title: Short text describing the task (required, non-empty)
  - Description: Optional longer text with additional details
  - Completed: Boolean status indicating if task is done (defaults to false)

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: User can complete an end-to-end workflow (add 3 tasks, list them, update one, mark one complete, delete one) in under 2 minutes
- **SC-002**: All 5 core operations (add, list, update, delete, complete) function correctly on first attempt
- **SC-003**: System provides clear feedback for 100% of invalid inputs without crashing
- **SC-004**: User can demonstrate all features without requiring documentation or help text
- **SC-005**: Application starts and displays main menu within 1 second of launch

## Assumptions

- Single-user, single-session application (no concurrency concerns)
- In-memory storage only - data is lost when application exits (by design for Phase I)
- Console environment supports standard input/output
- User understands basic command-line interaction (typing, pressing Enter)
- Task IDs remain stable during a session (no ID reuse after deletion)
