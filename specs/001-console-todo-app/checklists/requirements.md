# Specification Quality Checklist: Phase I Console Todo App

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-28
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Implementation-free | PASS | Spec focuses on what, not how |
| User stories prioritized | PASS | P1-P3 priorities assigned |
| Acceptance scenarios complete | PASS | All 5 user stories have Given/When/Then |
| Edge cases defined | PASS | 5 edge cases identified |
| Requirements testable | PASS | All FR-XXX are verifiable |
| Success criteria measurable | PASS | All SC-XXX have metrics |
| Assumptions documented | PASS | 5 assumptions listed |

## Notes

- All items pass validation
- Specification is ready for `/sp.plan`
- No clarifications needed - all requirements are clear and complete
