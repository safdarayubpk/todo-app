## Prompt

Project: Hackathon II - Evolution of Todo App (5-phase progression from console to cloud-native AI chatbot)

Core principles:
- Strict Spec-Driven Development: No code generation or manual editing until specifications, plans, and tasks are complete and validated
- AI-only implementation: All code must be generated by Claude Code; refine specs/plans until output is correct—no human-written code allowed
- Iterative evolution: Build incrementally across phases without breaking prior functionality; maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Reusability and modularity: Favor reusable components, patterns, and intelligence (e.g., agent skills, MCP tools) for scalability
- Security and isolation: Enforce user data isolation (e.g., JWT auth, per-user filtering) from Phase II onward
- Cloud-native readiness: Design for loose coupling, event-driven architecture (Dapr/Kafka), and containerization from the start

Key standards:
- Code quality: Clean, readable, type-annotated Python/Next.js; follow SOLID/DRY principles; include meaningful comments and docstrings
- Testing: Aim for high coverage with unit/integration tests; validate against acceptance criteria in specs
- Tech stack adherence: Next.js (App Router), FastAPI, SQLModel, Neon PostgreSQL, Better Auth (JWT), OpenAI Agents SDK, Official MCP SDK, Docker, Minikube/Helm, Dapr, Kafka/Redpanda
- Documentation: Comprehensive README, specs history, CLAUDE.md guidance; track decisions and iterations
- Performance and UX: Efficient queries, responsive UI (Tailwind), natural language handling in later phases

Constraints:
- No manual code writing or direct edits—refine artifacts only
- Monorepo structure with organized /specs (features/api/database/ui) and layered CLAUDE.md files
- Environment: UV for Python management; no unsupported libraries
- Deployment progression: Phase I (local console), II-III (Vercel + hosted backend), IV (Minikube), V (DigitalOcean Kubernetes)
- Bonus alignment: Prepare for reusable intelligence, blueprints, multi-language (Urdu), voice support

Success criteria:
- All phases build and run successfully with demonstrated features
- Full adherence to spec-driven workflow (judges review process/artifacts)
- Clean, production-ready code that evolves correctly across phases
- Working AI chatbot (Phases III-V) and cloud deployment (IV-V)
- Bonus features implemented where targeted

## Response snapshot

Created project constitution v1.0.0 with:
- 6 core principles: Spec-Driven Development, AI-Only Implementation, Iterative Evolution, Reusability/Modularity, Security/Isolation, Cloud-Native Readiness
- Tech Stack and Standards section with approved technologies table
- Development Workflow and Constraints section with monorepo structure and workflow sequence
- Governance section with amendment procedure and versioning policy
- Sync Impact Report confirming template compatibility

## Outcome

- Impact: Initial constitution established for Hackathon II project, providing governance foundation for 5-phase evolution
- Tests: N/A (documentation artifact)
- Files: 1 file created (.specify/memory/constitution.md)
- Next prompts: /sp.specify for Phase I console app, then /sp.plan and /sp.tasks
- Reflection: Constitution successfully captures all user-provided principles and constraints; templates are compatible

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Manual validation PASS - all placeholders filled, principles testable
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Validate constitution gates during first /sp.plan execution
